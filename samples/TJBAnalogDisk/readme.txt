The samples in this directory are from a disk of analog bass samples by T.J.Baker,
on Amiga aminet archive sample disk TJBAnalogDisk.lha, 
(http://aminet.net/package/mods/smpl/TJBAnalogDisk).
The samples have been converted from iff to wav format for auditioning,
and converted to Mozzi sample data in the *_mozzi folders.
