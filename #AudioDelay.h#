/** An audio delay line for comb filter, flange, chorus and short echo effects.
NUM_BUFFER_SAMPLES is the length of the delay buffer in samples, and should
be a power of two. The largest delay you'll fit in an atmega328 will be 512
cells, which at 16384 Hz sample rate is 31 milliseconds. More of a flanger or a
doubler than an echo. This version doesn't have feedback, for that use
AudioDelayFeedback instead. */
