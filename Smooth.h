/** A simple low pass filter for smoothing control signals. This algorithm comes
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter: y[i] := y[i-1] + Î± * (x[i] -
y[i-1]), translated as out = last_out + a * (in - last_out). It's not calibrated
to any real-world update rate, so if you use it at CONTROL_RATE and you change
CONTROL_RATE, you'll need to adjust the smoothness value to suit.
@tparam T the type of numbers being smoothed; valid types are char, unsigned char, int
and unsigned int.  No floats or longs.
@note Timing: ~5us for 16 bit types, ~1us for 8 bit types.
@todo Check timing and possibly make a fixed point version if it's worthwhile.
