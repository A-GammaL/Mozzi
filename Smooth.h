/** A simple low pass filter for smoothing control signals. This algorithm comes
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter: y[i] := y[i-1] + Î± * (x[i] -
y[i-1]), translated as out = last_out + a * (in - last_out). It's not calibrated
to any real-world update rate, so if you use it at CONTROL_RATE and you change
CONTROL_RATE, you'll need to adjust the smoothness value to suit.
@tparam set the type of numbers you want to use. For example, Smooth <int> mySmooth;
makes a Smooth which works with ints.
