Mozzi sound synthesis library for Arduino

NEWS


Version 0.01.1b

- Oscil.h:
	- added a setPhase() method to play a table from any position.
	- added setFreq_Q16n16() for setting frequency using Q16n16 fixed-point numbers
- _09_PhaseMod_Envelope example wasn't showing up in Arduino, fixed the name so it can be found.
- added triangle, saw and cos tables in sizes 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192
- added a float2mozzi_uint8.py, renamed the other wave converter scripts and made them more uniform
- utils.h/utils.cpp:
	- added Q16n16_mtofLookup(), a fast (but less accurate for non-integer midi note numbers) fixed point alternative to mtof().
	- added Q16n16_mtof(), a faster (but less accurate overall) fixed point alternative to mtof().
	- changed setupFastADC() to setupFastAnalogRead()
- replaced TABLE_NUM_CELLS with NUM_CELLS in tables

Version 0.01.1

- Changed utils.c to utils.cpp and changed all examples from #include utils.c to #include utils.h.
- Changed and capitalised names in saw_analogue512_int8.h
- Removed some wavetables which were too short. (should make more 1024 & 2048 tables)
- Oscil.h and Sample.h, added a constructor for declaring without a table, and a setTable() method, prompted by "konsumer' on mozzi-users
